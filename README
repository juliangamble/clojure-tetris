This is based on this gist:
https://gist.github.com/1207703

Which comes from Alex Yakushev's blog entry:
http://codethat.wordpress.com/2011/09/10/writing-tetris-in-clojure/

It also includes an obsolete Swing library deflayout:

The point here is to add Java Web start to enable it to be demoed to a wider audience
and promote the clojure community.
